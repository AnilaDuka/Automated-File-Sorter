# Automated File Sorter

This is a simple Python script that automatically sorts files into different folders based on their file extensions. It helps organize files in a specified directory into categories such as:

- **CSV files** (`.xlsx`)
- **Image files** (`.png`)
- **Text files** (`.txt`)

## Usage

1. Download the script.
2. Set the `path` variable to the directory you want to sort.
3. Run the script to automatically organize your files.
